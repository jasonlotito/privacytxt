privacy.txt
===========

The essential idea behind privacytxt.org is to create a system where it's easy
for browsers and users to discover the privacy information about websites. This
includes terms and conditions, links to the privacy settings page for user 
accounts, privacy policies, and other legal aspects.  By setting up a simple way
for users and browser to discover the privacy policies, settings, and terms and
conditions of a website, users will be more informed of privacy decisions.

Make the browsers better
------------------------

Browsers currently inform users about the security level of a site through the
use of SSL Certificates.  However, the security certificate does nothing to
inform users about the privacy implications of visiting a website.  Browsers
currently have no mechanism to auto-discover privacy policies, nor do they have
any means of allowing users a one-click access to their privacy settings page
for a website.

This is what privacy.txt hopes to solve.
